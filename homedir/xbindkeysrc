# We need a sleep here since the button triggers a few more key codes.
# It also triggers Control+Mod2+Control_L and Alt+Mod2+Alt_L. The sleep
# prevents that X receives those keypresses simultaniously. Therefore they
# might interfere and trigger unwanted actions. By the sleep we make sure that
# the Alt+Left is receive as distinct event.
#
# Note that "m:0x1c + c:23" is the default value. To find the current one, use xbindkeys -mk.
