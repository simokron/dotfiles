# dotfiles
If you somehow found this repository without being linked here (or perhaps even if you were), let me be the first to apologise for the mess that is my programming. This is merely a repository for my personal dotfiles and as such ***I offer no guarantees that any of it will work**. Furthmore, I hereby acknowledge that **I will not be responsible for any harm** which may arise from using any code contained herein.*

>Note that most of the work on these dotfiles is typically done by, or in conjunction with, [@danikron](https://github.com/danikron) so if you do not find what you are looking for here, it might be advisable to check out their repository, too.

Any general comments, tips, complaints and the like are welcomed!
